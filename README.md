# AIGIDetectionZOO

## Introduction ðŸ•µ
AIGIDetectionZOO provides APIs of extensive AIGI detectors in research literature, ranging from naive CNN to state-of-the-art. Contributions are always welcome!
<br>


## What are AIGI detectors?
Generally speaking, aigi detectors detect whether an image is generated by AI (DALLE, StableDiffusion, openai-image etc.). Existed detectors can be primarily categorized into 5 groups: spatial domain analysis, multimodal vision-language methods, frequency domain analysis, fingerprint analysis and patch-based analysis, according to [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15176). We here give an illustration of supported methods in this repo based on this categorization.


| Type | Methods |
|:-------:|:-------|
| Spatial Domain | [CNNSpot](https://github.com/PeterWang512/CNNDetection) |
| Multimodal Vision-language | [UnivFD](https://github.com/WisconsinAIVision/UniversalFakeDetect) |
| Frequency Domain | \ |
| Fingerprint | \ |
| Patch-based | [PatchCraft](https://github.com/Ekko-zn/AIGCDetectBenchmark) |


## To-do
- [  x  ] Implement LGrad as a representative of fingerprint methods
- [     ] Implement AIDE as a representative of both multimodal and frequency, and it's (or was) state-of-the-art
- [     ] Test batch and dataloader detection for every detectors



## How to use AIGIDetectionZOO
### Installation
`pip install git+https://github.com/kylin0421/AIGIDetectionZOO`<br>


### Load Detectors

Import and load detector with

```
import aigidetection_zoo as zoo

detector = zoo.load_detector("cnnspot")
```

You can check available detectors by

`print zoo.available_models()`<br>


### Detect a single image
```
from PIL import Image


img = Image.open("fake.png")
print(detector.detect_image(img))
```

This returns a single value between 0 and 1 where closer to 1 indicates likely being AI-generated and 0 indicates likely being real.

### Detect all images in a dataloader

### Train detectors on your own dataset
